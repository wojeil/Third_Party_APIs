Project Title
This Day Planner is an application that helps you set your tasks for the next workday.
You are provided with a fixed page that opens up a list in real live time. In that list you can save 
tasks and info to help you plan your workday. There is also a cool feature that indicates which time block 
you are in during the day. If it's grey then you are past that block, if it's red then you are currently in 
that time block and if it's green you are looking at the future...
